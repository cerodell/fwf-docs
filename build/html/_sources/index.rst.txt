Welcome to Fire Weather Forecast Model
======================================

Overview:
#########

   The Fire Weather Forecast (FWF) model is built off a preexisting fire-weather model,
   the Fire Weather Index System (FWI). The FWI system developed by Van Wanger and Pickett
   estimates how past/current/future weather conditions affect the moisture content within
   varied forest fuel layers across Canada. Knowing the fuel moisture content at all locations
   enables fire management agencies to understand where fires may occur and how fast they may grow/spread.

   The new FWF model differs from current FWI models by fully utilizing a numerical weather prediction (NWP)
   model. Fuel moisture codes/indices are calculated at every grid point within the NWP model at a 4 km spatial
   resolution. The Fine Fuel Moisture Code, Initial Spread Index, and Fire Weather Index are resolved at a
   one-hour temporal resolution while the Duff Moisture Code, Drought Code and Build up Index are solved
   once daily at noon local. This differs from the current FWI model that interpolates noon local weather
   forecast data from 900-point locations across Canada. The temperature is adjusted in the interpolated technic
   by applying a fixed standard adiabatic lapse rate of -6.5Â°C/km with  1 x 1 km resolution gridded terrain. 
   There is no correction of relative humidity. The interpolated weather data is then used to solve
   all moisture codes/indices once daily at noon local.
